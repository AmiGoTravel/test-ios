Your assignment is to create a simple Reddit client that shows the top 50 entries from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/top)


## What to do
Create a specific iOS App containing two screens:

1. First screen: use [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api) to list the top 50 entries
- Show: Title, author, thumbnail, number of comments, entry date (following a format like “x hours ago”) 

2. Second screen: details of selected entry from the list
- Feel free to show anything you want about the entry
